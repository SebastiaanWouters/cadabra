# Test Scripts Addition Summary

Comprehensive test scripts added to the Cadabra PHP package for easy testing and quality checks.

---

## What Was Added

### 1. Composer Scripts in `composer.json`

Added 7 new Composer scripts with descriptions:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "phpunit --colors=always",
    "test:unit": "phpunit --colors=always tests/Unit",
    "test:coverage": "phpunit --coverage-html coverage/",
    "cs:check": "php-cs-fixer fix --dry-run --diff --verbose",
    "cs:fix": "php-cs-fixer fix --verbose",
    "check": ["@cs:check", "@test:unit"],
    "fix": "@cs:fix"
  },
  "scripts-descriptions": {
    "test": "Run all PHPUnit tests",
    "test:unit": "Run only unit tests",
    "test:coverage": "Run tests with HTML coverage report",
    "cs:check": "Check code style with PHP CS Fixer",
    "cs:fix": "Auto-fix code style issues",
    "check": "Run all quality checks (code style + tests)",
    "fix": "Auto-fix code style issues"
  }
}
```

---

## Available Commands

### Testing

```bash
# Run all PHPUnit tests
composer test

# Run only unit tests (fast, no external dependencies)
composer test:unit

# Run tests with HTML coverage report
composer test:coverage
```

### Code Style

```bash
# Check code style (shows issues without making changes)
composer cs:check

# Auto-fix code style issues
composer cs:fix
```

### Combined Quality Checks

```bash
# Run all quality checks (code style + unit tests)
composer check

# Auto-fix code style (alias for cs:fix)
composer fix
```

---

## Integration with Project Automation

### 1. Enhanced Release Script

**File:** `scripts/release.sh`

The release script now uses the new Composer scripts:

```bash
# Uses: composer test:unit
# Uses: composer cs:check
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Consistent testing across local and CI
- ✅ Enforces code style before release
- ✅ Fails release if tests or style checks fail

### 2. Updated GitHub Actions CI

**File:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

CI pipeline now uses Composer scripts:

```yaml
- name: Run PHP code style check
  run: composer cs:check

- name: Run PHPUnit unit tests
  run: composer test:unit
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Same commands locally and in CI
- ✅ Faster builds (uses Composer's optimized autoloader)
- ✅ Easier maintenance (scripts defined once)

### 3. Updated Documentation

**Files Updated:**
- `packages/cadabra-php/README.md` - Added "Development" section
- `CLAUDE.md` - Updated PHP testing section
- `packages/cadabra-php/TESTING.md` - Complete testing guide (NEW)

---

## Documentation

### New `TESTING.md` Guide

Created comprehensive testing guide covering:

1. **Quick Start** - Get running immediately
2. **Available Commands** - All testing and style commands
3. **Test Structure** - Where tests live
4. **Running Specific Tests** - Unit, integration, benchmark
5. **Writing Tests** - Examples and best practices
6. **Test Coverage** - Generating reports
7. **CI Integration** - How tests run in GitHub Actions
8. **Code Style** - PHP CS Fixer configuration
9. **Debugging Tests** - Tips and tricks
10. **Common Issues** - Solutions to problems
11. **Best Practices** - Testing patterns
12. **Performance** - Keeping tests fast

### Updated README.md

Added "Development" section showing:
- All Composer test commands
- Test structure
- How to add new tests

### Updated CLAUDE.md

Enhanced PHP testing section with:
- Composer script commands (recommended)
- Direct PHPUnit commands (alternative)
- Code style commands

---

## Benefits

### Developer Experience

**Before:**
```bash
# Long commands to remember
vendor/bin/phpunit --colors=always tests/Unit
vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer fix --dry-run --diff --verbose
```

**After:**
```bash
# Simple, memorable commands
composer test:unit
composer cs:check
```

### Consistency

**Same commands everywhere:**
- Local development: `composer test`
- CI pipeline: `composer test`
- Release script: `composer test`
- Documentation: `composer test`

### Quality Enforcement

**Automated checks:**
```bash
# One command runs all quality checks
composer check

# Runs:
# 1. Code style check (cs:check)
# 2. Unit tests (test:unit)
```

**Release protection:**
- Release script runs `composer test:unit` and `composer cs:check`
- Both MUST pass for release to continue
- Impossible to release code with style issues

---

## Usage Examples

### Daily Development

```bash
# 1. Make code changes
vim src/Client/CadabraClient.php

# 2. Check if tests still pass
composer test:unit

# 3. Fix code style if needed
composer fix

# 4. Run all quality checks before committing
composer check
```

### Before Committing

```bash
# Quick check
composer check

# If all passes:
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature"
```

### Creating a Release

```bash
# Release script automatically runs:
# - composer cs:check
# - composer test:unit
make release VERSION=1.0.0
```

### CI/CD

GitHub Actions automatically runs:
```yaml
- run: composer cs:check
- run: composer test:unit
```

## Next Steps

### For Developers

1. **Learn the commands:**
   ```bash
   # See all available scripts
   composer list

   # Run quick check before committing
   composer check
   ```

2. **Use in daily workflow:**
   ```bash
   # After making changes
   composer test:unit

   # Before committing
   composer check
   ```

3. **Generate coverage:**
   ```bash
   composer test:coverage
   open coverage/index.html
   ```

### For CI/CD

The scripts are already integrated:
- ✅ GitHub Actions CI uses them
- ✅ Release script uses them
- ✅ Documentation mentions them

---

## Summary

**What you can now do:**

```bash
# Instead of remembering long commands
vendor/bin/phpunit --colors=always tests/Unit
vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer fix --dry-run --diff --verbose

# Just use simple commands
composer test:unit
composer cs:check

# Or even simpler
composer check  # Runs both!
```

**Key benefits:**
- ✅ **Easier to use** - Short, memorable commands
- ✅ **Consistent** - Same commands everywhere (local, CI, docs)
- ✅ **Automated** - Integrated into release process
- ✅ **Quality enforced** - Can't release with failing tests or bad style
- ✅ **Well documented** - README, CLAUDE.md, and TESTING.md

**Quality is now one command away: `composer check`** ✓
